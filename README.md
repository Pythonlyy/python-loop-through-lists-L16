# 🧺 Looping Through Lists with `for`

You can use a `for` loop to go through each item in a list. This is one of the most common and useful patterns in Python!

## 💡 What You'll Learn

* How to loop through a list using `for`
* What each item in a list represents during iteration
* How to name your loop variable clearly

---

## 💻 Example with Explanation

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### 🔈 Output

```
apple
banana
cherry
```

✅ Each time through the loop, the variable `fruit` holds the next item from the list.

## 📌 Key Notes

* Lists are surrounded by square brackets `[]`
* A `for` loop gives you each item in order
* You can name the loop variable anything (e.g., `item`, `name`, `x`)
* The loop stops automatically at the end of the list
